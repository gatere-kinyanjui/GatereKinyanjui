- Hi, I’m @Gatere
- Self-taught Frontend Developer

About Me:
I'm a passionate self-taught frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by diving into TypeScript for improved type safety and better tooling. Additionally, I'm actively learning React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

To enhance my styling capabilities, I'm also exploring Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. Collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning are at the core of my approach.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or project ideas!
